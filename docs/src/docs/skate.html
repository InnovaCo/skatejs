  <h2><code>skate (definition)</code></h2>

  <p>You define a component definition to the <code>skate()</code> function. The component name is used by the binding types to determine how to bind behaviour to the element. By default this conforms to the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/">Custom Element Spec</a> and corresponds to one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag name</li>
    <li><code>is</code> attribute (when the <a href="options/extends.html"><code>extends</code></a> option is specified)</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Creating a Component</h3>

  <p>The <code>return</code> value is a function / constructor that you can use to instantiate your component as an element:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    var element = skate({
      name: 'my-element'
    });

    // Use it like a function.
    // Awesomest way to create an element. Ever.
    document.body.appendChild(element());

    // Or a constructor.
    // Not as cool as using a function, but here to conform with the W3C spec.
    document.body.appendChild(new element());
  </noscript>

  <p>You may also pass properties that you want to set on the element instance after it's constructed:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="js">
    var element = skate({
      name: 'my-element'
    });

    var instance = element({
      prop1: true
    });

    // true;
    instance.prop1;
  </noscript>

  <p>This is just extra sugar so that interacting with the element API is less cumbersome programatically and feels more like using a view model. Really, that's what your element is anyway: a view model.</p>



  <h3>Native vs Polyfill</h3>
  <p>Underneath the hood, Skate will use native custom elements if the following criteria is met:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your browser supports <code>document.registerElement()</code>.</li>
    <li>You have not specified the <a href="options/type.html"><code>type</code></a> option.</li>
    <li>Your component has a hyphen in its name.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all other instances Skate will use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver"><code>MutationObserver</code></a> to polyfill the same behaviour. In browsers that do not have native support for Mutation Observers, you must include <a href="https://github.com/skatejs/polyfill-mutation-observer">a polyfill</a>.</p>
  <p class="notice notice-info">Though it's not slow by any means, you should always try and meet this criteria because using Native will <em>always</em> be faster and is synchronous out of the box.</p>
