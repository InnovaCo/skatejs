  <h2 id="h2-what-is-skate">What is Skate?</h2>
  <p>Skate is a minimal and performant foundation for easiliy building <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web Components</a>. It's built on the philosophy that all libraries should be focused on doing one thing well and therefore makes no assumptions about things better left to other libraries such as templating, data-binding and routing. It can be used standalone or along side other libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Backbone, Angular and more.</p>

  <h3>Custom Elements</h3>
  <p>Skate uses the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/">W3C Custom Element Spec</a> as the basis for defining its functionality and extends it to make it easier for you to build new custom elements as well as transition your legacy components to custom elements.</p>
  <p>Custom elements are just normal HTML elements that you give a custom name and functionality to:</p>

  <h2 id="simple-example">Simple Example</h2>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="html">
    <x-progress value="83"></x-progress>
  </noscript>
  <div class="sk-code-example">
    <x-progress value="83"></x-progress>
  </div>



  <h2 id="h2-installing">Installing</h2>

  <p>Skate is available on NPM:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="bash">
    npm install skatejs
  </noscript>

  <p>and Bower:</p>
  <noscript is="sk-code" lang="bash">
    bower install skatejs
  </noscript>

  <p>or you can download the <a href="https://github.com/skatejs/skatejs">source</a> from GitHub.</p>

  <h3>ES6 Modules</h3>
  <p>The Skate source resides in <code>src/</code> and is written using ES2015 (formerly ES6). If you're using a transpilation method, then you can <code>import skate from 'src/index';</code> and use it in your projects as you would any ES6 module.</p>

  <h3>UMD (AMD / CommonJS)</h3>
  <p>UMD files are located in the <code>lib/</code> directory. Load the <code>lib/index.js</code> file using the CommonJS or AMD loader of your choice.</p>
  <p class="notice notice-info">Skate does not provide a named AMD module. You should use an optimiser such as <a href="https://github.com/scalableminds/amd-optimize">amd-optimize</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/">r.js</a> that will generate this for you.</p>

  <h3>Global</h3>
  <p>If you're still skating old school the <code>dist/</code> directory contains the compiled ES5 source. The compiled source does not use a module loader; everything will just work. Access Skate as a global with <code>window.skate</code>.</p>
  <p class="notice notice-info">The global is always set no matter what and will trump any existing globals stored under <code>window.skate</code>. If you're using multiple versions of Skate on the same page, use a module format if possible. If it is not possible, you may call <code>skate.noConflict()</code> to restore the previous global and return the current one.</p>
